# Password_Manager
At the beggining I just want to mention, that I'm pretty much a newbie considering python, therefore my code is not as good as I would want it to be :c 
Hopefully, when I will feel more powerful in python I'll comeback and improve this program, and maybe add some new functions :)
A simple tool that helps you generate, save and store your passwords to different accounts

To start the whole program, you need to launch brain.py
You will be then navigated to the main screen, where you can whether provide your own data, or try some of the built-in functions.

1)  "Generate" - by clicking this button you will be redirected to password generator, where you can choose whether you want your password to contain normal or capital letters, number and special characters and how many of them should the generator provide. After marking the checkbox of any kind of symbols that are in option, you will see, that an entry appeared. In this entry you can put a number of how many signs of that kind should be in your generated password. After filling neccessary entries, you can click submit, so the whole magic happens - program randomly chooses as many chars from the kind you wanted, then shuffles it in random order and automatically pastes generated password in 'password' entry in main screen.

2)  "Save" - after you filled both entries for username and password, or you got your password generated you can save it to your own, private database, which is a JSON file, stored locally, on your PC.

3)  "Display" - forgot your password? Simply press the display button, then provide the username, that you want to see the password for, or type 'all' to get all of the stored data displayed.

4)  "Delete" - by typing the username and clicking 'delete' you are able to remove stored information for provided username from your database.
